# Time Schedule

This is a rough approach of how I want to spend my time during the week. With this schedule, I want to see how many hours I have left to work on projects, study and other tasks. I will try to follow this schedule and compare the calculated hours with the actual hours I spend on working during the week. This will help me to make adjustments and to improve my time management.

## Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays

> ***06:00 a.m.***
>> Wake up, breakfast, prepare to go to class
>>   
> ***06:50 a.m.***

> ***6:50 a.m***
>> Traveling   
>> 30 minutes for reading on the train
>>
> ***8:30 a.m.***

> ***8:30 a.m.***
>> Class   
>> 2-3 hours of personal time   
>>
> ***14:30 p.m.***

> ***14:30 p.m.***
>> Traveling home  
>> 30 minutes for reading on the train
>> 
> ***16:00 p.m.***

> ***16:00 p.m.***
>> Have lunch
>>
> ***17:00 p.m.***

> ***17:00 p.m.***
>> 
>> 
> ***20:00 p.m***

> ***20:00 p.m***
>> Dinner + free time
>>
> ***21:00 p.m.***

> ***21:00 p.m.***
>> Low energy tasks
>>
> ***23:00 p.m.***

> ***23:00 p.m.***
>> Read before go to sleep.
>>
> ***23:30 p.m.***

Max personal time -> $3+3+2 = 8 hours$  
Min personal time -> $8 - 1.15 - 1 = 5:45 hours$

Some days I have driving classes at afternoon (-1:15 h)   
At class maybe I could have two hours at most (-1 h)

Total time (low bound approximation) -> $5 hours * 4 days = 20 hours$

## Wednesdays, Sundays

> ***07:00 a.m.***
>> Workout
>>
> ***09:00 a.m.***

> ***09:00 a.m.***
>> Breakfast + free time
>>
> ***10:00 a.m.***

> ***10:00 a.m.***
>> 
> **13:00 p.m.**

> **13:00 p.m.**
>> Lunch + free time
>>
> ***15:00 p.m.***

> ***15:00 p.m.***
>>
> ***20:00 p.m.***

> ***20:00 p.m.***
>> Dinner + free time
>>
> ***21:00 p.m.***

> ***21:00 p.m.***
>>  Low energy tasks
>>
> ***23:00 p.m.***

> ***23:00 p.m.***
>> Read before go to sleep.
>> 
> ***23:30 p.m.***

Max personal time -> $3+5+2 = 10 hours$  
Min personal time -> $8 - 1.15= 8:45 hours$

Some Wednesdays I have driving classes (-1:15 h)   
Total time (low bound approximation) -> $8 hours * 2 days = 16 hours$

## Saturdays

Ideally, Saturdays should be a relaxing day so I can rest.  
The maximum time I will spend on doing tasks or assignments it is 6 hours.

## Total available time:
$20 + 16 + 6 = 42 hours$

This is the first approach I came up with. Over the following weeks I will count the actual hours spent and compare them to the calculated hours. Then, I will make adjustments.
